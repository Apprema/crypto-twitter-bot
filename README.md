# Crypto Twitter Bot
The twitter bot pulls information from the [Coin Market Cap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/). The prices for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, NEO, and Ripple are stored as formatted variables and tweeted out every 4 hours automatically.

## Motivation
I was interested in making a bot for twitter and I am interested in the Cryptocurrency market so I mixed the two together and make a quick bot that tweets the current price of the Cryptocurrencies I am most interested in.

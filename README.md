# Crypto Twitter Bot
The twitter bot pulls information from the [Coin Market Cap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/). The prices for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and NEO are stored as formatted variables and tweeted out every 4 hours automatically.

## Motivation
I was interested in making a bot for twitter and I also find myself fairly interested in the Cryptocurrency market lately so I decided to mix the two together and make a quick bot.
